## Get☀️weather⛈️data🌈

Here's a single webpage in vanilla _Javascript_ to get weather data by requesting an `API`.

Put the name of the city you are looking for and hopefully you'll get what you need 😁.

You'll need to suscribe to `Openweather` API to get the key to fetch data.
👉 https://openweathermap.org/api

PS: _environment variable_ is in an env.js file.
